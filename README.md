Problem-1: Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets I

Description: 
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of integers.

A triplet of indices (i, j, k) is a mountain if:
i < j < k
nums[i] < nums[j] and nums[k] < nums[j]
Return the minimum possible sum of a mountain triplet of nums. If no such triplet exists, return -1.

Problem-2: Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets II
Description: 
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of integers.

A triplet of indices (i, j, k) is a mountain if:
i < j < k
nums[i] < nums[j] and nums[k] < nums[j]
Return the minimum possible sum of a mountain triplet of nums. If no such triplet exists, return -1.
